# Privacy Policy for Chexxo
At Chexxo, accessible from https://github.com/Chexxo, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Chexxo and how we use it.

If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us through [email](mailto:chexxo@ins.hsr.che?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Chexxo).

## Collected information
### Firefox
Chexxo does not send any information outside in the firefox version. The only infomation collected is the local log (see chapter Log Files). Those log files can only be processed by us if you need our help and therefore provide us with them. Those log files cannot be accessed by us without you exporting them and providing them to us over a communication channel. We will treat the information provided with care and only use it to solve your problem.

### Chromium
Since Chromium based browsers do not provide an option to read the certificate from the webRequest-API, a server component is needed in order for Chexxo to function properly. Additionally to the local log files mentioned in the chapter about firefox above the Chromium version of the extension generates logs on the server.

Whilst those server logs do contain unique id's those are newly generated on every log-message and cannot be associated with a user. Chexxo will only be able to connect a log entry on the server with you if you choose to share your local log with us in order to get help regarding a problem with the extension. We will treat the information provided with care and only use it to solve your problem.

## Log Files
### Local
The extension logs all errors that occur within the extension. Those errors contain the URL where the error occured as well as a unique id and an error message.

### Server (Chromium only)
The server logs all errors that occur. Those errors contain the URL where the error occured as well as a unique id and an error message. Additionally there are some logs for debbuging purposes which can never be associated to a user since they lack a unique id for log correlation.

## Extension Privacy Policy Only
This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for users of our extension with regards to the information that they shared and/or collect in Chexxo. This policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than the extension.

## Consent
By using our extension, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its Terms and Conditions.
